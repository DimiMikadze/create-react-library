[![Dev Dependencies](https://img.shields.io/david/dev/DimiMikadze/create-react-library.svg)]()

based on Facebook's <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app" target="_blank">Create react app</a>.
We are constantly updating repository with the updates of `create-react-app`, so we have all new features and bug fixes of it.

## Converted to custom setup

Moved all dependencies to dev dependencies because we don't need extra dependencies for our library after build, but we want all this features while developing: 

* React, JSX, ES6, and Flow syntax support.
* Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
* A dev server that lints for common errors.
* Import CSS and image files directly from JavaScript.
* Autoprefixed CSS, so you donâ€™t need `-webkit` or other prefixes.
* A `build` script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production.

## Getting Started

Clone repo

````
git clone https://github.com/DimiMikadze/create-react-library.git
````

Install dependencies

`npm install` or `yarn install`

Start development server

`npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the demo app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Library files

All library files are located inside `src/lib`  

## Demo app

Is located inside `src/demo` directory, here you can test your library while developing

## Testing

`npm run test` or `yarn run test`

## Build library

`npm run build` or `yarn run build`

Produces production version of library under the `build` folder.

## Publish library

`npm publish`

## Troubleshooting

#### Usage of other libraries within your library

- Add the library as a peer dependency in package.json (effectively requiring the calling project to provide this dependency)
- Add the library as a dev dependency in package.json (effectively allowing this library to successfully build without complaining about not having this dependency)
- Add the library to the externals config in your webpack.config file(s). By default, only react and react-dom are there, meaning that those are the only two libraries that you can use within your new shared library.
